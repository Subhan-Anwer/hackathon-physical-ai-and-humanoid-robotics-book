# Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Chapter 1.1: What is Physical AI?

### Section Headings
- Introduction to Physical AI
- Defining Physical AI vs. Traditional AI
- The Embodiment Principle
- Core Characteristics of Physical AI
- Applications and Use Cases
- Physical AI vs. Virtual AI: Key Differences
- Summary and Key Takeaways

### Key Concepts
- Physical AI definition: AI systems that interact with the physical world through embodiment
- Embodiment: The notion that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- Sensorimotor contingencies and their role in learning
- The importance of real-world interaction for intelligence
- Grounded vs. ungrounded representations
- Affordances and environmental interaction
- Embodied cognition principles
- The role of physics in AI development

### Practical Labs or Demos
- Lab 1.1.1: Physical AI simulation setup - Students configure a basic simulation environment to observe AI agents interacting with physical environments
- Demo 1.1.2: Virtual vs. Physical task comparison - Students compare how a simple task (e.g., object manipulation) differs when performed in simulation vs. reality
- Activity 1.1.3: Sensorimotor exploration - Students implement a simple agent that learns about its environment through interaction

### Notes for RAG-friendly chunking
- Break content into concept-focused chunks: "Physical AI definition", "Embodiment principle", "Sensorimotor contingencies"
- Create separate chunks for comparison tables (Physical AI vs. Traditional AI)
- Isolate examples and use cases into individual chunks for easy retrieval
- Tag chunks with difficulty level (beginner) and prerequisite knowledge (basic AI concepts)
