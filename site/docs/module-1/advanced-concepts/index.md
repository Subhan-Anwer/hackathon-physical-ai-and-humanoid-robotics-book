# Advanced ROS 2 Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- Learn about real-time considerations and determinism
- Implement multi-robot systems and networking
- Configure security and authentication

## 1. Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- Reliability and durability policies
- History and depth policies
- Deadline and lifespan policies
- Lifeguard and liveliness policies

## 2. Real-time considerations and determinism
- Real-time scheduling in ROS 2
- Memory allocation and determinism
- Thread management and priorities
- Performance optimization techniques

## 3. Multi-robot systems and networking
- Network configuration for multiple robots
- Communication patterns for multi-robot systems
- Coordination and task allocation
- Distributed computing concepts

## 4. Security and authentication
- ROS 2 security architecture
- Identity and access management
- Data encryption and integrity
- Secure communication protocols

## Exercises
- Configure different QoS policies for various scenarios
