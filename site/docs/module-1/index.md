# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that serves as the nervous system for modern robots. Students will learn how to design, build, and deploy distributed robotic systems using ROS 2's communication primitives, tools, and ecosystem.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Design distributed robotic systems using ROS 2 communication patterns
- Implement custom message types and interfaces
- Debug and profile ROS 2 applications
- Deploy ROS 2 applications across multiple machines
- Integrate ROS 2 with real hardware and simulation environments
