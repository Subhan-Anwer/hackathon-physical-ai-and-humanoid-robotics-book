# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Course

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in robotics, AI, and human-robot interaction. You'll learn to build intelligent robotic systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, particularly robotics. It encompasses the development of intelligent agents that can interact with the physical world through perception, decision-making, and action. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI must handle the complexities, uncertainties, and real-time constraints of the physical world.

Key characteristics of Physical AI include:
- Real-time perception and decision making
- Uncertainty management in dynamic environments
- Embodied cognition and interaction
- Integration of multiple sensory modalities
- Safe and robust physical interaction

## What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are robots with human-like characteristics, particularly in their physical form and behavior. They typically feature:
- Bipedal locomotion similar to human walking
- Human-like manipulation capabilities with arms and hands
- Anthropomorphic body structure
- Human-like interaction capabilities
- Advanced AI for understanding and responding to humans

## Course Structure

This curriculum is organized into four core modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the middleware framework that connects all robot components
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master simulation environments for testing and training
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Implement AI-powered perception and control
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Build systems that understand natural language commands

Each module includes theoretical foundations, practical labs, and assessment criteria to ensure comprehensive learning outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Programming experience in Python and C++
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux development environments
- Fundamentals of control systems and robotics

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:
- Design and implement distributed robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create and validate robotic systems in simulation environments
- Implement AI-powered perception and control systems
- Build robots that understand natural language commands
- Integrate multiple technologies into complete robotic systems
