# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - The Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

## Overview
This module explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotics systems, focusing on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that enable robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute complex tasks. Students will learn to implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning with LLMs, and the integration of these components with ROS 2 for intelligent humanoid robot behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture and its applications in robotics
- Implement voice command recognition and processing using OpenAI Whisper
- Design cognitive planning systems that translate natural language to ROS 2 actions
- Integrate LLMs with computer vision for object identification and manipulation
